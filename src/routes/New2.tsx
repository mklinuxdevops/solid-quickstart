<p>DevOps Beginners Interview Questions and Answers</p>

<p><br />
1. What is the role of DevOps in the industry today?</p>

<p>DevOps is a methodology that brings together IT operations and the development team to deliver high-quality software products faster. This synergy begins with the design and continues throughout the product&#39;s lifetime until it is fully deployed.</p>

<p>2. In the DevOps terminology, what is the contribution of agile software development?</p>

<p>Both DevOps and Agile strive for quicker software delivery, yet they are fundamentally different. DevOps is a workplace culture that brings IT Ops and development together to remove roadblocks to faster product delivery. Agile methodology is a pure technique that emphasizes quick, small, incremental, and iterative software releases with a built-in feedback loop for customers. It eliminates most of the customer&#39;s blind spots in the development process and better aligns the product with the requirements.</p>

<p>3. What are the different types of DevOps tools?</p>

<p>Puppet, Chef, Selenium, Git, Ansible, Jenkins, and Docker are a group of DevOps tools that are extremely popular.</p>

<p>4. Explain the different DevOps phases.</p>

<p>The DevOps lifecycle is divided into eight phases.</p>

<p>Planning: The original blueprint of a software product is dealt with at this phase.</p>

<p>Coding: This phase entails writing code based on the software requirements outline and the outcomes of the planning phase.</p>

<p>Build: The software product is built using all the code requirements mentioned in the preceding phases.</p>

<p>Testing: A product is put through its paces during the testing process to verify that it satisfies all industry-standard testing criteria and is of the highest quality.</p>

<p>Integration: The integration phase brings together code from several teams to create a single product.</p>

<p>Deployment: The final product is supplied at the deployment phase at the end of the development and testing cycle, ensuring that changes do not disrupt ongoing operations.</p>

<p>Operations: In this phase, business-as-usual operations are carried out on the deployed code.</p>

<p>Monitoring: The newly installed software&#39;s performance is monitored to verify that it meets user and business needs.</p>

<p>5. What are the numerous advantages that DevOps provides?</p>

<p>Some of the essential advantages of DevOps include:</p>

<p>Software delivery that is continuous and ongoing</p>

<p>Collaboration and communication between teams have improved.</p>

<p>6. How will you go about implementing DevOps practices in an organization?</p>

<p>Breaking the development into stages or phases is an excellent strategy.</p>

<p>Phase 1: For roughly 2 or 3 weeks, assess the existing system and identify potential areas while mapping them to business objectives.</p>

<p>Phase 2: A Proof of Concept (PoC) will assist in bringing the majority of the individuals on board if they haven&#39;t already. Once accepted, a team may begin putting the strategy into action by creating a project plan.</p>

<p>Phase 3: Now is the time for DevOps to dive in with version control, unit testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring to produce high-quality software on time.</p>

<p>7. How do continuous delivery and continuous deployment vary?</p>

<p>Continuous deployment ensures that code passes automated tests and is ready to be securely released into production, while continuous delivery ensures that code is ready for deployment. Continuous delivery is a less risky technique in which existing business applications are not disrupted. On the other hand, Continuous Deployment is concerned with expediting the processing and distribution of information.</p>

<p>8. How does software configuration management fit into DevOps?</p>

<p>Software configuration management is an essential component of DevOps because it:</p>
